# Discord WoW Classes & Professions Tracker Bot

This Discord bot tracks **World of Warcraft classes, specializations, and professions** of users on your server. It does not assign roles; instead, it reads usersâ€™ existing roles and provides statistics and summaries.

---

## Features

- Tracks **classes** (`:warrior:`, `:priest:`, etc.) based on user roles.
- Tracks **specializations** (`:tank:`, `:dps:`, `:healer:`).
- Tracks **professions** (`:mining:`, `:cooking:`, etc.).
- Generates statistics for the number of users per class, specialization, or profession.
- Supports **custom Discord emojis** for nicer visualization.
