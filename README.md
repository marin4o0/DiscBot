# Discord WoW Classes & Professions Tracker Bot

This Discord bot tracks **World of Warcraft classes, specializations, and professions** of users on your server. It does not assign roles; instead, it reads usersâ€™ existing roles and provides statistics and summaries.

- Tracks original 9 **classes** (`Warrior:`, `Priest:`, etc.) based on user roles.
- Tracks **specializations** (`Tank:`, `Dps:`, `Healer:`).
- Tracks **professions** (`Mining:`, `Cooking:`, etc.).
- Generates statistics for the number of users per class, specialization, or profession.
- Supports **custom Discord emojis** for nicer visualization.
